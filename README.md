<h2>Objective of the subject</h2>
<p>The content of the course is the analysis of various synchronization patterns. Our goal is to offer students the opportunity to become familiar with various synchronization problems along with their solutions. By synchronization problems we mean the solution of the coordination of concurrently (perhaps also simultaneously) performed tasks in order to ensure the integrity of the data with which the individual tasks work; of course, we also demand that a correct calculation result be achieved.

In the second part of the semester, we focus on some modern areas of programming that are developing rapidly: parallel calculations on graphics cards and asynchronous programming.</p>
