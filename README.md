## Objective of the subject

The content of the course is the analysis of various synchronization patterns. Our goal is to offer students the
opportunity to become familiar with various synchronization problems along with their solutions. By synchronization
problems we mean the solution of the coordination of concurrently (perhaps also simultaneously) performed tasks in order
to ensure the integrity of the data with which the individual tasks work; of course, we also demand that a correct
calculation result be achieved.

In the second part of the semester, we focus on some modern areas of programming that are developing rapidly: parallel
calculations on graphics cards and asynchronous programming.
